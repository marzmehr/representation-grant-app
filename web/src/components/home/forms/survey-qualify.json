The collection of `assets` that a person left behind is called their `estate`<br><br>Representation Grant is an umbrella term that includes different types of these court documents. A Grant of Probate is a type of Representation Grant specifically for executors named in a `Will`.<br><br><b style='color: #003366'>Court Costs and Fees</b><br>There is no cost to use this service and the service will create the documents you need to file with the Court. There will be costs associated when filing which are:\n<ul>\n<li>There will either be a $200 filing fee or a $0 filing fee (if the estate is worth less than $25,000).</li>\n<li> There will be costs for swearing or affirming the `affidavits` that this service will create for you. Each affidavit costs $40 to swear or affirm at a courthouse. An application usually has 3 or more affidavits.</li>\n<li>There will be probate fees if the estate is worth more than $25,000.
